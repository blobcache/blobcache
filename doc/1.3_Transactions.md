# Transactions

All data in Blobcache is read and written through a transaction.
Transactions can be created in one of a few different modes.
The most important distinction is between read-only transactions and read-write transactions (called mutating transactions).
Read-only transactions cannot modify the cell or the store, but they can read from both.
Write transactions leave the Volume changed when they successfully commit.
Transactions started after the Commit will observe the changes made.

> The transaction semantics in Blobcache are sometimes called Serializable Snapshot Isolation.
Other letters that people like include: A, C, I, and D.

## Operations
This is a list of operations that can be performed in a Transaction.

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Post       |  give data, get a hash
| Get        |  give a hash, get data
| Exists     |  check if a CID exists in the store, without retrieving data.
| Delete     |  removes a CID and the data associated with it.
| Load       |  reads the contents of the Volume's cell.
| Save       |  sets the contents of the Volume's cell to a given value.
| Commit     |  finishes the transaction, all of it operations take effect atomically.
| Abort      |  cancels the transaction, and cleans up its resources.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

`Get`, `Exists`, `Load` and `Abort` are all available in read-only transactions.
Everything else requires a mutating transaction.

All of the operations performed during a transaction only take effect if `Commit` is called.
