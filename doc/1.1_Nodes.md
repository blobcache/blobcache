# Nodes

A single running instance of Blobcache is called a Node.

Each node manages a set of Volumes.
Volumes can be manipulated by local clients, and after intentional configuration, peers on the network.

Nodes are uniquely identified by a public key, and use this key when communicating over the network.
All communication in Blobcache is performed between two mutually authenticated Nodes.

> Nodes only communicate over the network in response to user actions.
They do not automatically connect to peers or any global set of nodes.
