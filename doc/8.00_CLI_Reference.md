# CLI Reference

## mkvol
Short for "make volume", these commands all create a new volume in the system.
These commands assume the root is using the `BasicNS` schema, which is the default.

### `mkvol.local <name>`
Creates a new volume on the local node.
This is the most basic kind of volume in Blobcache.

#### Positional Arguments

#### Flag Arguments
All flags are optional and have sensible defaults.

- `--schema` the name of the schema to use for the volume.
- `--max-size` the maximum size of a blob in the volume. The cell will have a max size of half this value.
The current implementation does not support blob sizes greater than `16MB`.
- `--hash-algo` the name of the hash algorithm used by the volume to determine `CIDs`
    - `BLAKE3_256` the default
- `--host` the endpoint of the Node to create the Volume on.

### `mkvol.remote <endpoint> <volume-oid>`
Creates a remote volume on the local Node.
A remote volume is a Volume on another Node, but on the remote Node it won't be a remote volume, it would be a local volume, or some other kind of primitive volume.
It's only called a "remote" Volume on the local node.

#### Positional Arguments
- `peer-id` the peer-id of the Node which has the target volume.
- `volume-oid` the `OID` of the volume on the remote Node.

### `mkvol.vault <inner-volh>`
Vault Volumes encrypt all of their contents including both the cell and all the blobs.
Vault Volumes require an inner Volume to be specified, which they will store their content in.

#### Positional Arguments
- `inner-volh` A handle to the inner volume that will store the ciphertext blob and cell data.
