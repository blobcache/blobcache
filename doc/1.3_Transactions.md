# Transactions

All data in Blobcache is read and written through transactions.
Transactions can be created in one of a few different modes.
The most important distinction is between read-only transactions and read-write transactions (called mutating transactions).
Read-only transactions cannot modify the cell or the store, but they can read from both.
Write transactions leave the Volume changed when they successfully commit.
Transactions started after a transaction Commits will observe the changes made.

> The transaction semantics in Blobcache are sometimes called Serializable Snapshot Isolation.
Blobcache transactions are also Atomic and Durable.

## Operations
This is a list of operations that can be performed in a Transaction.

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Post       |  give data, get a hash
| Get        |  give a hash, get data
| Exists     |  check if a CID exists in the store, without retrieving data.
| Delete     |  removes a CID and the data associated with it.
| Load       |  reads the contents of the Volume's cell.
| Save       |  sets the contents of the Volume's cell to a given value.
| Commit     |  finishes the transaction, all of it operations take effect atomically.
| Abort      |  cancels the transaction, and cleans up its resources.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

`Get`, `Exists`, `Load` and `Abort` are all available in read-only transactions.
Everything else requires a mutating transaction.

All the operations performed during a transaction only take effect if `Commit` is called.
