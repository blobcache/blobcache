# Schemas

Schemas are the structure that governs the contents of a Volume.

Schemas allows Blobcache to help enforce invariants required by the application.
They also allow Volumes to communicate information to Blobcache in a format it already understands.

The default Schema is no Schema.  No Schema means that all possible values can occupy the Volume's cell and any amount of blobs can exist in the store.

The reference implementation of Blobcache also defines some Schemas, which it uses to keep track of which Volumes point to which other Volumes.

## BasicNS
BasicNS is a very simple schema, used to organize subvolumes in a namespace.
Each subvolume has a unique name in the namespace.
Subvolumes can be looked up by name, added, and deleted just by performing transactions on the Volume.

Volumes with a BasicNS schema are either empty or contain 1 blob.
The single blob is a stream of JSON objects, newline separated, which describe the entries in the namespace.
The cell contains the CID of that blob.
