# JSNS

`ns` provides a simple namespace that maps human-readable volume names to object identifiers (OIDs). These commands help you create and list named volumes.

All of the commands work off of the namespace root, which is the volume to base the operations out of.
If you don't specify any root for the namespace than the Node's root volume will be used.
There are several ways to configure an alternate root.
- `--nsr <volume-id>` will attempt to open the volume via fiat (it's up to the node's arbitrary policy).
- `--nsrh <volume-handle>` will parse the handle, and use it as the namespace root directly.
- The environment variable `BLOBCACHE_NS_ROOT` will be parsed as both an OID and a volume handle.
  Depending on which variant is successfully parsed, OpenFiat or OpenFrom will be called, the same as for the flags.
  The flags take precedence over the environment variable.

## `blobcache ns create <name>`
Creates a new volume at the given namespace path `name` using the default local volume specification.
Prints the resulting volume handle and the name.

### Positional Arguments
- `name` The namespace path (e.g., `my-volume`, `team/project/docs`).

## `blobcache ns ls`
Lists entries in the root of the namespace, with columns for rights, OID, and name.
